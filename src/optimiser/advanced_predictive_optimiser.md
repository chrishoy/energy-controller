## How the Code Works ðŸ§ 

The new logic is designed to be proactive and truly cost-optimal by following these steps:

1.  **Identify All Needs**: It first determines the complete set of time slots that must be warm (`comfort_slots`).

2.  **Handle "Free" Heat**: It schedules heating for any slot with a **negative price**, as this is always economically beneficial.

3.  **Iterative Optimization**: The core of the new logic is a `while` loop that runs as long as there are comfort slots that aren't yet covered by a heating cycle. In each iteration:

      * It finds the **earliest uncovered comfort slot**. This is the next heating problem to solve.
      * It defines a "candidate window" for preheating, which includes the target slot and the `preheat_slots` immediately before it.
      * It scans this entire window to find the **single cheapest slot** to turn the heater on.
      * It schedules heating for that single best slot.
      * Finally, it updates its understanding of which comfort slots are now covered by this new heating cycle (for the duration of `retain_slots`) and repeats the process until all comfort periods are satisfied.

This approach guarantees that for every block of time that requires warmth, the system has proactively found the most cost-effective moment to run the heater.
